    <p>Honey and garlic are always a dynamic duo, especially when used to create a flavor-packed sauce 
    for chicken thighs. We like serving this main dish over mashed potatoes with Bacon-Balsamic Brussels Sprouts on the side.</p>

<!-- Dessert meals-->
 <h2>Desserts</h2> 

<ul>     
<li>    
<strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>     
<p>Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.</p>    
</li>    

<li>    
    <strong>Cakes</strong>     
    <p>Perhaps the most popular dessert of all time, cake contains a combination of flour,
    sugar, eggs, butter or oil, leavening agents (such as yeast or baking powder), 
    and sometimes milk or water. It’s topped with sweet and creamy icing for the ultimate treat.</p>    
    </li> 

    <li>    
        <strong>Cookies</strong>     
        <p>Made from flour and sugar, cookies are usually small, flat, and round. To create sandwich cookies, just place a small amount 
            of jam or icing in the middle of two cookies. Cookies can also be cut in elaborate shapes, perfect for different seasons 
            and events.</p>
